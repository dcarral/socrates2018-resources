# SoCraTes 2018 (resources)

[SoCraTes](https://socrates-conference.de/) is a yearly [open-space](http://openspaceworld.org/wp2/) taking place in Soltau (Germany) where hundreds of attendees gather every year to discuss software-related topics.

During the 2018 edition a lot of attendees have shared session results, including valuable resources, using a private Slack workspace. Aligning with the original open-space spirit of making discussions available to everyone (also those not attending the event), this repository tries to compile most of them.
